Build a production-grade web application called:

🛡 ScamShield AI Pro

AI-Dominant Hybrid Scam Detection System

This version must implement hierarchical security logic, not simple weighted averaging.

🎯 CORE INPUT

The app must use:

ONE single message input box.

Automatically extract URLs, ₹ amounts, UPI IDs, phone numbers, and brand names.

No separate fields.

🧠 DETECTION LAYERS
1️⃣ Extraction Layer

Extract:

URLs

₹ amounts

UPI IDs

Phone numbers

Brand mentions (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Amazon, etc.)

2️⃣ Heuristic Detection
Psychological Manipulation

Detect:

Urgency words

Fear triggers

Authority impersonation

Financial pressure

Link Intelligence

For each URL:

Suspicious TLD (.xyz, .top, .ru, .click)

IP-based URL

Multiple hyphens

Non-HTTPS

Brand Spoof Detection

Maintain official domain dictionary.
If brand mentioned AND URL does not match official domain:
→ brand_spoof = True

Financial Manipulation

Detect:

Verification fee language

UPI collect patterns

Suspicious amount formatting

Credential Harvest Detection

Detect keywords:

verify

login

reset

confirm

password

review account

🤖 GEMINI AI INTEGRATION (MANDATORY)

Use google-generativeai library.

Model: gemini-1.5-flash

Prompt Gemini:

You are a cybersecurity AI specialized in scam detection.
Analyze the message and return ONLY JSON:

{
"risk_score": number (0-100),
"reasoning": "short explanation",
"confidence": "Low/Medium/High",
"scam_type": "type or None"
}

Wrap in try/except.
If API fails, fallback to heuristic-only mode.

🛡 FINAL SCORING ARCHITECTURE (CRITICAL)

DO NOT use pure weighted averaging.

Implement hierarchical scoring:

STEP 1 — Compute heuristic_score
STEP 2 — Get ai_score + ai_confidence
STEP 3 — Apply AI Dominance Rule

If:

ai_confidence == "High"
AND

ai_score >= 70

→ final_score = max(ai_score, heuristic_score)

AI overrides.

STEP 4 — Apply Category Escalation Rules
Financial Scam Escalation

If:

financial_request
AND

brand_spoof

→ final_score = max(final_score, 80)

Credential Harvest Escalation

If:

brand_spoof
AND

credential_keywords detected

→ final_score = max(final_score, 75)

UPI Collect Scam Escalation

If:

UPI collect pattern detected

→ final_score = max(final_score, 85)

Investment Scam Escalation

If:

guaranteed returns language

→ final_score = max(final_score, 85)

STEP 5 — Safe Cap Rule

If:

No suspicious signals
AND

ai_score < 40

→ final_score = min(final_score, 30)

📊 RISK CATEGORIES

0–30 → Safe
31–60 → Suspicious
61–100 → High Risk

Never allow:

Identified scam_type != None
AND final_score < 60

That is logically inconsistent.

🍎 UI REQUIREMENTS – APPLE STYLE

Design must be minimal and premium.

Large white space

Rounded corners

Soft shadows

Inter font

Subtle gradient background

Animated circular risk indicator

Smooth fade-in transitions

Glass-style cards

Elegant color palette

Show:

Risk score

Risk category

AI confidence

Scam type

AI reasoning

Extracted components

No clutter.
No heavy frameworks.

⚙ STABILITY REQUIREMENTS

No crashes

Graceful Gemini fallback

Fast response

Clean error handling

Proper JSON parsing

📘 README MUST EXPLAIN

Hierarchical security scoring

AI dominance rule

Escalation matrix

Brand spoof detection

Credential phishing handling

Financial fraud handling

Why weighted averaging is unsafe in cybersecurity

IMPORTANT

This must feel like:

A real cybersecurity product, not a student demo.

Scoring must align with severity.

Explanations must match numerical risk.

Obvious phishing must score 75+.
UPI collect scam must score 85+.
Brand spoof + credential must score 75+.
Legitimate messages must remain below 30.

Build complete runnable application.

END PROMPT

This is your final production-grade architecture.

After implementing this, your system will:

✔ No longer under-score phishing
✔ No longer mark scams Safe
✔ Align explanation with severity
✔ Impress judges technically

Now we’re operating at professional-level security logic.
